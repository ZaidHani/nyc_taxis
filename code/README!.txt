how to run the project:
step 1:
go to the etl folder and change the database properties to suit your own postgres database
step 2:
run the app.py file
the app.py file will do the etl proccess to the data from January 2020 to the data from the last 4 months
step 3:
run airflow in your local machine to make the whole process scheduled

the relationships between the tables are all in the erd.pgerd file
